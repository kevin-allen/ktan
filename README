ktan is a C++ program to perform data acquisition with the GNU/Linux operating system. This program was developed to work with the Evaluation board from Intan Technologies.  The visual interface of kacq was written using the gtk (gtkmm) library. We have run and tested ktan on Fredora 19 or later vesions.

Here are some of ktan's features:

1) Can record up to at least 64 channels (depending on hardware).
2) User can rewind the oscilloscope to re-examined recently acquired signals.
3) Independent threads for acquisition, recording and oscilloscope to take advantage of multi-core processors.
4) Control recording and visualize data from a remote computer via ssh (-X). 

To compile ktan, you need to install the gtkmm30 package:
yum install gtkmm30-devel.x86_64


To install: ./autogen.sh;./configure; make; su -; make install

If you are using a primitive version of the software, make sure that you have install the USB drivers for the Opal Kelly. They can be download from the intan web site.

cp 60-opalkelly.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/

In the directory with the compiled program, you will need 2 files
main.bit
libokFrontPanel.so
